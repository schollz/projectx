    This is documentation based off https://upspin.io/. 

    It's mean to be a nice starting point for content, 
    as well as styled nicely (thanks Upspin).

    It also has the added benefit of being 100% accessible within 
    Github, so that you actually don't need to host it.

    But, if you do want to host it, just checkout main.go for running it.

    To get started, change "githubuser" to your Github user. 
    Then change ProjectX to the titular name of your project. 
    Then change projectx to the Github name of your project.
